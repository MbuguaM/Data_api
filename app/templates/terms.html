  </p>

  <h3>Payment</h3>
  <p>
    By selecting a paid plan you agree to pay Kensus API the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for a paid plan and will cover the use of that service for a monthly
    or annual subscription period as indicated. You represent and warrant that you are authorized, or have the permission of the authorized signatory of the credit card or charge card provided to Kensus API, to pay any fees incurred from use of the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unless you notify Kensus API before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel a paid account, your paid subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription
    fee (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. If you exhaust the allocation of API requests included in your plan you authorize us to collect the then-applicable fee (as well as any taxes) using
    any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you in exchange for another block of API requests. Paid plans can be canceled at any time in the Account section of the website.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unused API requests included in your plan do not roll over at the end of the month. Extra API requests purchased in blocks will rollover and have no expiration date.
  </p>

  <h3>Refund and cancellation policy</h3>
  <p>
    You may cancel your subscription at anytime and you will not be charged for the following period(s). However Kensus API will not issue a refund for the current or previous months.
  </p>

  <h3>Service level agreement</h3>
  <p>
    If we do not achieve and maintain the Service Levels for each plan as described in this SLA, then you may be eligible for a 25% credit towards your monthly service fees.
  </p>
  <p>
    This SLA and any applicable Service Levels do not apply to any performance or availability issues:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Due to factors outside our reasonable control (for example, natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism, riots, government action, or a network or device failure external to our data centers, including at your site or between your site and our data center);</li>
    <li>That result from the use of services, hardware, or software not provided by us, including, but not limited to, issues resulting from inadequate bandwidth or related to third-party software or services;</li>
    <li>Caused by your use of a Service after we advised you to modify your use of the Service, if you did not modify your use as advised;</li>
    <li>During or with respect to preview, pre-release, beta or trial versions of a Service, feature or software (as determined by us);</li>
    <li>That result from your unauthorized action or lack of action when required, or from your employees, agents, contractors, or vendors, or anyone gaining access to our network by means of your passwords or equipment, or otherwise resulting from your failure
      to follow appropriate security practices;</li>
    <li>That result from your failure to adhere to any required configurations, use supported platforms, follow any policies for acceptable use, or your use of the Service in a manner inconsistent with the features and functionality of the Service (for example,
      attempts to perform operations that are not supported) or inconsistent with our published guidance;</li>
    <li>That result from faulty input, instructions, or arguments (for example, requests to access data that does not exist);</li>
    <li>That result from your attempts to perform operations that exceed prescribed quotas or that resulted from our throttling of suspected abusive behavior;</li>
  </ol>
  <h5>Monthly uptime calculation</h5>
  <p>
    "Monthly Uptime Percentage" for each API Service is calculated as Total Request Attempts less Failed Requests divided by Total Request Attempts in a billing month for a given API subscription. Monthly Uptime Percentage is represented by the following
    formula:
  </p>
  <p>
    Monthly Uptime % = (Total Request Attempts - Failed Requests) / Total Request Attempts * 100
  </p>
